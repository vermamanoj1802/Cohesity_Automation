# INVENTORY FILE FOR AGENT INSTALLATION AND REGISTRATION
# -------------------------------------------------------
# This Ansible inventory file is designed to specify hosts and connection parameters
# for installing and registering Cohesity agents on both Linux and Windows systems.
# You can add or remove hosts as required for your environment.

# --- HOST GROUP: workstation ---
# This group is for management workstations used to run Ansible playbooks.
# Hosts listed here are not necessarily agent targets, but can be used for orchestration.

                       # --- NOTES ---
# - To add more hosts, simply list them under the appropriate group.
# - For Linux hosts, create a separate group and provide SSH-based connection variables.
# - Always keep passwords secure—never hard-code them; use environment variables or Ansible Vault.
# - This file can be used as-is with Ansible commands or referenced in playbooks via the -i flag.
